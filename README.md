when the button is clicked, we go to next screen with the options available as
check boxes. We can either clear all selected chk boxes or select few or cancel the
dialog options by selecting the below options (CLEAR ALL/CANCEL/DONE).The selected 
items are displayed on the front screen accordingly.
